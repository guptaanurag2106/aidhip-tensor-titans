# Problem Statement

## AI Driven Hyper Personalization Recommendations System

### What We're Building

Imagine a banking tool that truly understands you - not just as a customer, but as an individual with unique financial goals and preferences. Our platform goes beyond one-size-fits-all recommendations by creating a personalized financial journey.

### The Smart Approach

We're developing an intuitive dashboard that does more than just suggest products. It learns your financial personality and provides:

-   Top Recommended Products: Perfectly matched to your financial profile
-   Passive Investment Options: Safe choices for when you want to balance risk

### Why It's Different

Most banking recommendations feel generic. Ours are different:

-   Tailored to your specific financial DNA
-   Balances high-potential opportunities with safe investments
-   Understands that even risk-takers need a financial safety net

### User Experience

A clean, simple interface where you can:

-   See personalized product recommendations at a glance
-   Explore both exciting and stable financial options
-   Understand why each product might be right for you

Our goal? Making complex financial decisions feel simple, personal, and empowering.

## 🏃 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ewfx/aidhp-tensor-titans.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies (Need Python, Nodejs installed)
    ```sh
    pip install ./code/requirements.txt
    cd ./code/src/client
    npm install
    ```
3. Setup environement variables
    For client: Copy the `code/src/client/.env-sample` file to `code/src/client/.env`. No need to update any values.
    For backend: Copy the `code/src/.env.local` file to `code/src/.env`. Update the `code/src/.env` file with correct `Open Router` API key (Get one from [OpenRouter Api Key](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys)).

4. Run the project
    
    Run the client
    ```sh
    cd ./code/src/client
    npm run dev
    ```

    Run the backend:
    ```sh
    cd ./code/src
    python backend.py
    ```

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

-   🔹 Frontend: React (Typescript)
-   🔹 Backend: Flask (Python)
-   🔹 Database: Currently just uses CSV files
-   🔹 Other: Open Router APIs (using `google/gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05:free` model)
