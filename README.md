# Problem Statement
##AI Driven Hyper Personalization Recommendations System

### What We're Building
Imagine a banking tool that truly understands you - not just as a customer, but as an individual with unique financial goals and preferences. Our platform goes beyond one-size-fits-all recommendations by creating a personalized financial journey.

### The Smart Approach
We're developing an intuitive dashboard that does more than just suggest products. It learns your financial personality and provides:

- See personalized product recommendations at a glance
- Explore both exciting and stable financial options
- Understand why each product might be right for you

Our goal? Making complex financial decisions feel simple, personal, and empowering.
