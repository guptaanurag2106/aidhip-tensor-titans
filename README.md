# Problem Statement
##AI Driven Hyper Personalization Recommendations System

### What We're Building
Imagine a banking tool that truly understands you - not just as a customer, but as an individual with unique financial goals and preferences. Our platform goes beyond one-size-fits-all recommendations by creating a personalized financial journey.
